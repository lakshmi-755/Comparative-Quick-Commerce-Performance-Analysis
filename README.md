# 📊 Comparative Quick-Commerce Performance Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview
This project is an **end-to-end data analytics solution** designed to compare the performance of three quick-commerce grocery delivery platforms: **Blinkit, JioMart, and Swiggy Instamart**.  
The objective is to analyze **business performance, operational efficiency, and customer behavior** and transform raw transactional data into **actionable insights** using data storytelling.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Compare revenue, order trends, and customer value across platforms  
- Analyze delivery efficiency, delays, refunds, and service ratings  
- Identify high-value, delay-sensitive, and churn-prone customer segments  
- Enable data-driven decision-making through interactive dashboards  

---

## 🧾 Dataset Description
Each row in the dataset represents a **customer order**, containing:
- Platform name  
- Order value  
- Delivery time and delays  
- Refund requests  
- Service ratings  
- Customer feedback and sentiment  
- Order date and time  

The dataset captures **business metrics, operational performance, and customer experience**, making it ideal for analytics and visualization.

---

## 🧹 Data Preprocessing (Python)
Data preprocessing was performed using **Python** to ensure accuracy and consistency:
- Handling missing and inconsistent values  
- Converting date and time columns to proper datetime formats  
- Standardizing categorical fields (platforms, delivery status)  
- Cleaning customer feedback and sentiment fields  

---

## 🛠 Feature Engineering
New features were created to extract deeper insights:
- **Customer Segmentation** based on order value  
- **Churn Risk Classification** using delays, refunds, and sentiment  
- **Delivery Speed Categories** (Fast, Average, Slow)  
- **Time-based features** such as order hour and peak periods  

These features transformed raw data into **business-understandable metrics**.

---

## 🗄 SQL Database Integration
- Created a structured **SQL (MySQL) database**  
- Defined appropriate schemas and data types  
- Loaded cleaned and transformed data for scalable querying  

This step reflects **real-world data handling practices**.

---

## 📊 Power BI Dashboard Development
The SQL database was connected to **Power BI**, where:
- Relationships and **DAX measures** were created  
- KPIs were designed for quick insights  
- Interactive visuals and slicers were added  
- Dynamic narratives were used for storytelling  

---
